# disR
An R package to interact with the Development Information System data. The package includes a library of functions to search and summarize data for the Feed the Future Initiative. 

The data are stored on Google Drive. You can use most functions with the data if you download it to your local computer. There are some convenience functions to access the data using the `googledrive` R package. To use those functions, you need to authenticate into Google Drive through R each session. Some USAID staff outside of the Data and Analytics team may have access to the Google Drive data.
